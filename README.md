# VBA_Challenge
 repository for VBA challange.
## Overview of Project

The purpose of this challenge is to use VBA code to facilitate the analisys of a series of stocks by the end user. Using VBA we hope to create a summary table, easy to read and visualize.To ensure optimal performance and scalability of the *VBA Code*, we will challenge ourselves to refactor the script, in order to make it more efficient. (eg. Having the VBA script successfully run faster, using less memory and making it easier to read)


## Results
The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).
