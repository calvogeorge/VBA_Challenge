# VBA_Challenge
 repository for VBA challenge.
 
## Overview of Project

The purpose of this challenge is to use VBA code to facilitate the analysis of a series of stocks by the end user. Using VBA we hope to create a summary table, easy to read and visualize. To ensure optimal performance and scalability of the *VBA Code*, we will challenge ourselves to refactor the script to make it more efficient. (eg. Having the VBA script successfully run faster, using less memory and making it easier to read)


## Results

As a result of the refactoring process the vba scripts run time has been improved around *84% ~ 83%*, as shown in Image 1.1 the original script took 0.89 seconds to run, while the new refactored code ran in 0.14 (Image 1.2). A similar improvement in the scripts run time can be seen for the analysis for 2018, where the run time decreased  from about 0.92 (Image 2.1) to 0.15 seconds(Image 2.2).

## Summary

An advantage of Refactoring code is that it allows you to improve a script by eliminating redundancies, improving the readability, and understanding of the code, potentially making it easier to maintain. A disadvantage is that the process can be time consuming while not offering warranties that you will be able to achieve a more efficient code.
